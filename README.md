### Library Management System

#### Overview:
This Python project implements a Library Management System using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The system consists of classes representing a Library and Student, allowing users to interact with the library by borrowing and returning books. It provides a simple yet effective user interface for performing standard library actions.

#### Features:
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The program utilizes OOP concepts to create classes for the Library and Student entities, facilitating efficient management of library resources and user interactions.
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface prompts users to select from a range of standard library actions, such as borrowing or returning books.
- **Flexibility**: The modular design of the system allows for easy expansion and customization, enabling the addition of new features and functionalities to meet specific requirements.
- **Potential Enhancements**: Users can enhance the system by incorporating additional features such as unique book IDs, multiple copies of the same book, return dates, late return fees, and more.

#### Installation:
No additional installations are required beyond Python itself.

#### Usage:
1. Run the Python script.
2. The program will present a user interface prompting users to select from available library actions.
3. Choose the desired action, such as borrowing or returning a book, by entering the corresponding option number.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the selected action.
5. Explore the code to understand the underlying logic and structure of the library management system.
6. Customize and expand the classes to incorporate additional features as desired.

#### Example:
- Start the library management system by running the Python script.
- Select from the available options presented in the user interface, such as borrowing a book or returning a book.
- Follow the prompts to provide any necessary input or information required to complete the selected action.
- Explore the code to understand how the Library and Student classes are implemented and how they interact with each other.

#### Notes:
- Users can customize the system by adding new features or modifying existing ones to better suit their needs.
- Experiment with different functionalities and scenarios to gain a deeper understanding of OOP principles and their practical applications.

Enjoy using the Library Management System to efficiently manage library resources and user interactions!
